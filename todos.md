    - Moving averages (1 min, 5 min, 15 min windows)
    - Historical aggregations (hourly, daily)
- dashboard view
- add key-based auth for ingestion
- add token-based auth for dashboard
- rate limiting for ingestion
- threshold-based alerts

- consider using MQTT protocol as sensors have limited bandwidth, intermittent connectivity
- consider using Protobuf serialization instead of JSON for data transfer
- batching of events by sensors
- data retention policy
- data compression policy
